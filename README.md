### DESCRIPTION
In this project I realised a counter, the majority of the code is based on Javascript but I used part of HTML to develop the structure and CSS for graphical aspects.

### COUNTER FEATURES

<div align="center"> ![counter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88582424/140183862-cc386bfd-aea5-4d28-9b00-2c385ee08e21.png) </div>


In addition to the counter, I created two buttons that can increase and decrease the value. I realised also a "reset button" that turns the counter value to zero.
Once the value is greater than zero, the number changes the colour to green, otherwise if it's lower than zero, it turns red.
